Cross-Border Merger & Acquisition
======
This course is a selective one for junior students. I prepared the lectures based on the textbook “Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring Activities” (10th edition), written by Donald M. DePamphilis. As my research areas are corporate strategy and international business, I focused on the strategy-oriented M&A and integrated knowledge of strategic management with the course. The course assessment is in diversified forms. There are two individual assignments. The first one is a mini case study about negotiation in acquisitions. The other one is a calculation problem about firm valuation in M&A. I also asked students to analyze a complex M&A case in small groups and present in class.  

Corporate Governance
======
This course is a required one for sophomore students majoring in accounting. It includes 9 sessions, mainly about the basics of corporate firms, board of firms, corporate equity structure design, incentive mechanism for senior executive, mechanism of information disclosure. I also added introduction of relevant theories in this course, like transaction costs economy, the principle-agent theory and signaling theory. The course involves extensive discussion, presentation and debates. A final examination is included as the main assessment.
