About this course
======
This course is a selective one for sophomore students. I prepared the lectures based on the textbook “Strategic management: Theory & cases: An integrated approach”, written by Hill, C. W. and Jones, G. R., & Schilling. M. A.This course introduces the evolution of corporate strategy in practice and classical theories of strategy. Students will be guided to learn to grasp analytic methods, such as SWTO analysis, Five Forces, and PEST analysis. The couse focuses on the competitive strategy of the firm, examining issues central to its long- and short-term competitive position. Students are placed in the role of key decision makers and asked to address questions related to the creation or reinforcement of competitive advantage.  The initial focus is on industry analysis and competitive advantage as it derives from the firm's strategic investments. We then study the process through which strategic change takes place. Since the case method has been found to be the most suitable pedagogical device for illustrating the myriad complexities of the real business world in which strategic decisions are made, the couse includes more than 20 cases for students to discuss and as after-class write-ups. Group presentations of the cases will be required and graded. Each member of the group will receive the same grade for the presentation. Performance will be assessed by the following parts and in corresponding weights: participation accounts for 15%, case write-ups account for 15%, group presentations account for 20%, and final exam (open book test) accounts for 50%.
