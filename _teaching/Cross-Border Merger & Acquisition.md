About this course
======
This course is a selective one for junior students. I prepared the lectures based on the textbook “Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring Activities” (10th edition), written by Donald M. DePamphilis. As my research areas are corporate strategy and international business, I focused on the strategy-oriented M&A and integrated knowledge of strategic management with the course. The course assessment is in diversified forms. There are two individual assignments. The first one is a mini case study about negotiation in acquisitions. The other one is a calculation problem about firm valuation in M&A. I also asked students to analyze a complex M&A case in small groups and present in class.
